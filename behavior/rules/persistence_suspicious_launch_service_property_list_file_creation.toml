Identifies when a Property List (plist) file is created in a LaunchAgents directory using the built-in PlistBuddy
utility. An adversary may attempt to evade detection by using PlistBuddy to build a plist file line by line or modify an
existing plist file. Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads and
maintain persistence.
